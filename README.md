- 👋 Hi, I’m @OldComputerGuy
- 👀 I’m interested in old computers
- 🌱 I’m currently thinking about releasing a lot of retro source-code
- 💞️ I’m looking for people to help me maintain Mophun gaming system and all of its games.
- 📫 You can reach me by messaging me.

The source code I provide must not be used for commercial purposes, it is for educational purposes only, this can be considered fair use.
I would also ask you not to redistribute any of the code found here. The copyrights to all code are reserved, any trademarks, brands or other
properties not relating to the source codes are the property of their respective owners, for instance the name 'M*rtal K*mbat' does not belong to me,
the source code to the game does, the code in it's compiled binary form (the ROM) maybe someone elses property. Hope that makes things clear. 

The code provided is completely unsupported, probably not even buildable without a lot of effort, so please don't expect me to support you,
I may answer the occasional question though.
