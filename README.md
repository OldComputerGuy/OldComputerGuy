- 👋 Hi, I’m @OldComputerGuy
- 👀 I’m interested in old computers
- 🌱 I’m currently thinking about releasing a lot of retro source-code
- 💞️ I’m looking people to help me maintain Mophun gaming system and all of its games.
- 📫 You can reach me by messaging me.

The source code I provide must not be used for commercial purposes, this is because it can be considered fair use,
I would also ask you not to redistribute any of the code found here.
